# Digital Diary ðŸ““

This repository contains the source code for my digital diary. Currently, I am just adding different configurations, guides, and other things that I find useful or might need in future. I will be adding more content as I go along.

## Motivation

Heroku has just ended their free tier for hobby projects. And I have decided to move my projects to DigitalOcean. As I was setting up my vm, I realized that I might need to do this again in the future. So I decided to create this repo to keep track of the boilerplates I use. Currently I am adding boilerplates for setting up the server, docker, and CI/CD.

## Future Plans

Create a documenting website for this repository using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) or [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/).
